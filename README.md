# pomodoro-app-in-python
The code is a simple GUI-based Pomodoro timer application that helps users manage their time in work sessions, followed by short breaks and a long break. The application has four constants that represent different colors and font styles. The WORK_MIN constant represents the duration of the work session in minutes, the SHORT_BREAK_MIN constant represents the duration of the short break in minutes, and the LONG_BREAK_MIN constant represents the duration of the long break in minutes.

There are two buttons, a Start button, and a Reset button, that allow the user to start and reset the timer respectively. The Start button calls the start_timer function, and the Reset button calls the reset_timer function.

The start_timer function sets the reps variable to 0 and increases it by one with each call. The function calculates the duration of the work session, short break, and long break in seconds. If the reps variable is divisible by 8, the function calls the count_down function with the duration of the long break and changes the title label to "Break" with a red font color. If the reps variable is divisible by 2, the function calls the count_down function with the duration of the short break and changes the title label to "Break" with a pink font color. Otherwise, the function calls the count_down function with the duration of the work session and changes the title label to "Work" with a green font color.

The count_down function takes a count argument, which represents the duration of the work session, short break, or long break in seconds. The function converts the duration into minutes and seconds, updates the timer text on the canvas, and recursively calls itself with the updated duration of count - 1 every second. If the duration reaches 0, the function calls the start_timer function, which starts the next work session or break.

The reset_timer function cancels the current timer, resets the timer text on the canvas to "00:00", resets the title label to "Timer," and clears the check marks.

Finally, the code sets up the GUI with a tomato image on the canvas, the timer text, the title label, and the two buttons. When the user clicks the Start button, the countdown begins, and the timer text updates every second. When the user clicks the Reset button, the timer is reset, and the user can start a new work session.
